      <h1>Top Games by Combined Metacritic &amp; User Scores</h1>
      <p>
        This page fetches the most popular PC games from Steam and ranks them
        based on a combination of professional Metacritic scores and Steam user
        ratings. The data is pulled live via a proxy to avoid cross‑origin
        restrictions; please allow a few moments for the scores to load.
